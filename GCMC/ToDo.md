# Grain Boundary Grand Canonical Monte Carlo

A working to-do list for the use of grand canonical Monte Carlo to study variable-density thermodynamics of grain boundaries. 

## Preliminary ToDo:
1. Test whether DSC lattice shifts account for the variable density (the answer is probably no, but a good sanity check)

## C++ LAMMPS "fix" ToDo:
1. Implement addition/subtraction of atoms from the grain boundary
2. Implement movement of atoms inside the grain boundary region
3. Implement DSC lattice shifts
4. Implement "copying" of middle grain boundary to edges of simulation box

Optional:

5. Implement grain boundary region detection
6. Implement grain boundary creation
