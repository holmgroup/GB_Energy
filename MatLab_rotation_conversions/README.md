 
This code is from Degraef, Rollett, and Rohrers's rotation conversion paper: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/932b/4eaa22afb4384815db12dfd197c24c7ba355.pdf

1. Open Matlab and navigate to folder, create script
2. Read documentation for each function for input conventions for each rotation representation (to understand theory, read paper)
